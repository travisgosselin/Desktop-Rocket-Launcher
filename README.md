# USB Desktop Rocket Launcher
Control application to manipulate a USB rocket launcher from a web interface or mobile application.

This is a test application to try out new technologies. I have versions started in ASP.NET 5 (MVC 6) and SignalR 3. Also playing around with latest version of Ionic (apache cordova via visual studio 2015).

The client library is great for programming against the USB Rocket Launchers from Think Geek:
